# Photo-video-organizer

## Requirements
The application requires the **metadata-extractor** library to be installed.  
**metadata-extractor** is a Java library for reading metadata from media files.  
Installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/drewnoakes/metadata-extractor).

## What the Project Does
The **Photo-video-organizer** application is designed to organize photos and videos. It scans each photo and video to retrieve its creation date and then automatically creates a folder with the date in the format `year-month`. The photo or video is then placed into the corresponding folder.

If a photo or video does not have a creation date, it can be manually moved into a folder, or a new folder can be created for it.

## Why the Project is Useful
This project is useful for organizing your photo and video collections, making it easier to manage and locate media based on their creation dates.
